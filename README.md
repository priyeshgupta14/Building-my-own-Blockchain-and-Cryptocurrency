# Building-my-own-Blockchain-and-Cryptocurrency
A blockchain-based cryptocurrency that utilizes proof of work for its consensus mechanism. It features a simple and easy-to-use command-line interface for users to interact with.

Features:

Proof of Work: It uses a proof of work algorithm to validate transactions and generate new blocks.
Balance Checking: Users can check their account balance by querying the blockchain with their public key.
Transaction Verification: All transactions are verified by nodes on the network to ensure they are valid and do not involve double-spending.
Transaction Adding: Users can add transactions to the blockchain by specifying the recipient's public key, the amount of currency to transfer, and their own private key to sign the transaction.
Block Mining: Miners can mine new blocks by solving a cryptographic puzzle that involves finding a nonce that, when combined with the block data, produces a hash value that meets a certain difficulty threshold.
Transaction Output: The blockchain can output all transactions in a human-readable format for auditing and analysis purposes.
Getting Started
To get started with it, simply download the source code and run the my_own_blockchain.py script. You can interact with the cryptocurrency through the command-line interface.
